Chatbot & Tutor Interaction System – Product Concept

We will implement a dual-mode communication system that clearly separates AI Chatbot support and Human Tutor interaction, while keeping the experience seamless, modern, and mobile-first.

1. Dual Chat Modes (Single Interface)

The system will have one chat card/interface with a toggle switch that allows users to switch between:

AI Chatbot

Live Tutor

This ensures clarity for users while maintaining a clean and intuitive UI.

2. AI Chatbot (Self-Service Mode)
Purpose

The chatbot is designed to handle all course-related queries using pre-fed static website content and structured knowledge data.

Key Capabilities

The chatbot will be trained on all static content of the website, including:
Everything
home about our divisions
Courses

Internship programs

Modules

Eligibility

Duration

Tools & technologies

FAQs

It will intelligently analyze user intent, even if:

The question has typos

The sentence structure is unclear

The query is asked from a different angle

The bot will perform end-to-end (A to Z) analysis of the question and return the most accurate, relevant answer.

Works as a 24/7 instant support system for general and detailed course information.

Limitations (By Design)

If a user wants deep guidance, personalized explanation, or advanced elaboration, the chatbot will suggest connecting with a live tutor.

3. Tutor Chat (Human Interaction Mode)
Access Control (Mandatory)

Before initiating a tutor chat, the user must provide:

Full Name

Email ID

Mobile Number

Only after submitting these details will the live tutor chat be enabled.

This ensures:

Lead validation

Serious inquiries only

Better follow-up and engagement

Tutor Chat Features

One-to-one real-time messaging

Used for:

Detailed course explanations

Career guidance

Personalized recommendations

Advanced doubts beyond chatbot scope

4. UI/UX Design Requirements (Critical)
Mobile-First Design

The entire chat system must be mobile-first and fully responsive

Optimized for:

Smartphones

Tablets

Desktop (secondary priority)

Real-Time Messenger-Like Experience

The interface should feel similar to Messenger / WhatsApp / Instagram DM:

Typing indicator (animated dots when the bot or tutor is typing)

Smooth message transitions

Instant response rendering

Clear distinction between user and system messages

Minimal, modern, and distraction-free UI

5. User Flow Summary

Default mode: AI Chatbot

If user wants deeper explanation:

6. Business & Product Advantages
