Introduction
Welcome to the AI-Powered Logistics Practitioner Program (Level 1).
This handbook is designed to help you understand how Artificial Intelligence (AI)
transforms the logistics industry through data-driven insights and smart
automation.
You’ll explore how businesses collect, understand, and use data to make faster and
better decisions.
AI and the World Around Us
Artificial Intelligence is the science of teaching machines to think, learn, and make
decisions using data.
You see AI every day — in YouTube recommendations, food delivery apps, and map
navigation systems.
AI allows computers to recognize patterns, predict outcomes, and help humans
work more efficiently.
Key Idea:
AI = Machines learning from data to make decisions.
Understanding the Difference: ML, Automation, and AI
 Automation performs a fixed set of actions repeatedly (like an oven timer).
 Machine Learning (ML) improves its performance based on data and
experience.
 AI combines automation and learning to make intelligent choices — for
example, predicting traffic or deciding the fastest delivery route.
Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0
Industries have evolved through major revolutions:
1. Steam and mechanization
2. Electricity and mass production
3. Digital and computing
4. Artificial Intelligence and data
Logistics 4.0 represents the AI-driven era — where warehouses, delivery systems,
and supply chains use smart technologies to operate efficiently.
AI in Logistics
Leading logistics companies like Amazon, DHL, Maersk, Flipkart, and Delhivery use
AI for:
 Route optimization
 Fleet management
 Inventory tracking
 Predictive maintenance
 Demand forecasting
These technologies improve accuracy, reduce costs, and deliver better customer
experiences.
Durkkas Business Framework (DBF)
The Durkkas Business Framework (DBF) explains how organizations use data to
drive continuous improvement.
It consists of seven stages:
Data → Understand → Recommend → Keep → KPI → Automate → Scale
In this program, you will learn how each stage connects to real-world logistics.
Data – The Fuel of AI
Data is the foundation of all AI systems.
In logistics, data may come from:
 GPS tracking of vehicles
 Warehouse stock records
 Customer feedback
 Delivery timings and costs
Every digital activity creates information that can be analyzed to improve
decisions.
Activity Example:
Imagine your team manages a delivery fleet. Identify all possible data sources that
could help you make smarter decisions about timing, routes, or cost efficiency.
From Raw Data to Insights
A raw dataset might contain information like:
Order ID Route Distance Fuel Cost Delivery Time
By studying patterns in such data, we can answer important questions — like which
route is fastest or which driver saves more fuel.
Understanding Data – Turning Numbers into Knowledge
Collecting data is not enough. Understanding what it means is the key.
Having data without analysis is like having ingredients without a recipe.
This is where analytics helps.
Three Levels of Analytics
1. Descriptive Analytics – What happened? (e.g., How many deliveries were
made today?)
2. Predictive Analytics – What might happen? (e.g., Will tomorrow’s orders
increase?)
3. Prescriptive Analytics – What should we do? (e.g., Which route should we
choose?)
In logistics, companies use these three types to make daily decisions.
Practical Example
 Descriptive: A report shows delivery times for each route.
 Predictive: A model forecasts which routes will face delays due to traffic.
 Prescriptive: AI recommends the best driver and route combination to save
time.
Finding Insights from Logistics Data
In group tasks, you may analyze simple datasets showing columns such as:
 Date
 Orders
 Fuel Cost
 Delay Time
 Customer Rating
Your goal is to identify trends and explain what they mean — for example, “As fuel
costs increased, delay times also increased.”
From Understanding to Recommendation
Once we understand data, AI can use it to recommend the best actions.
Recommendation systems analyze patterns from the past to predict the best next
step.
Examples:
 Netflix recommending movies
 Google Maps suggesting faster routes
 Flipkart showing related products
In logistics, AI recommends:
 Optimal delivery routes
 Best driver assignments
 Inventory restocking times
How AI Recommends
AI follows a logical flow:
Data → Algorithm → Suggestion
For instance, when planning a route, AI considers distance, time, cost, and traffic
before giving the best recommendation.
Smart Route Challenge
Imagine you are an AI system.
Your task is to choose the best delivery route using available data about time, fuel
cost, and customer satisfaction.
Each group justifies their choice and compares their reasoning with how AI systems
actually make similar decisions.
This helps you think like a machine — focusing on facts, not guesses.
Measuring Success – The Role of KPIs
Once decisions are made, it’s important to measure whether they worked.
Even AI needs a report card.
KPI (Key Performance Indicator) means a measurable value that shows how well a
process is performing.
Common Logistics KPIs:
 OTIF (On-Time-In-Full): Percentage of deliveries completed on time.
 TAT (Turnaround Time): Average time taken per delivery.
 Fuel Efficiency: Distance covered per unit of fuel.
 Customer Satisfaction: Based on feedback or ratings.
 Inventory Accuracy: How correctly stock is recorded and updated.
Understanding KPI Values
For example:
If 90 out of 100 deliveries are on time, your OTIF is 90%.
High KPIs mean consistent performance.
Low KPIs signal areas needing improvement.
AI continuously monitors these metrics and learns from them to optimize
operations automatically.
Designing a KPI Dashboard
To track performance, logistics analysts often create dashboards that visualize
data.
Each team can select three important KPIs and display them using charts or graphs.
This helps identify patterns like “Fuel efficiency improves when delay time
decreases.”
A dashboard makes decision-making quick and transparent.
Sustaining Success – Keep and Improve
The “Keep” stage in DBF means maintaining consistent performance.
By tracking KPIs regularly, companies ensure that improvements last and that AI
systems continue learning effectively.
Automation and Continuous Improvement
After understanding and measuring, businesses can automate certain processes —
for example:
 Auto-assigning drivers based on performance data
 Automatically reordering inventory
 Predicting maintenance schedules
Automation saves time and reduces human error.
Scaling Success
The final stage of DBF, Scale, focuses on expanding what works.
Once a company automates successful operations, it can scale to more locations,
more customers, or more services — all powered by data.
Capstone Project – From Data to Scale
As a learner, you will design your own AI-Powered Logistics Model using the DBF
approach.
Each group chooses a scenario such as:
 Fleet Management
 Warehouse Optimization
 Customer Experience
 Performance Dashboard
 Cost Efficiency
Your project should cover all seven stages of DBF:
Data → Understand → Recommend → Keep → KPI → Automate → Scale
Project Template:
DBF Stage What to Explain
Data What data is collected (orders, feedback, routes, etc.)
Understand What insights are found?
Recommend What decisions or routes are suggested?
Keep What information should be retained for the future?
KPI What metrics will be tracked?
Automate What tasks can AI perform automatically?
Scale How can the system expand or improve?
Showcase and Evaluation
Each team presents their project to demonstrate how AI transforms logistics data
into smart decisions and measurable success.
Focus on clarity, storytelling, and real-world application of DBF rather than
technical complexity.
Conclusion
You have now explored how data fuels AI, how insights turn into recommendations,
and how success is sustained through KPIs and automation.
AI-powered logistics is not just about machines — it’s about creating intelligent
systems that make better decisions every day.
Final Thought:
Data builds decisions. Decisions build direction. Direction builds Durkkas.
